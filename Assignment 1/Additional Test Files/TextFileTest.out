CST 8152 – Compilers - Assignment #1

Due Date: prior or on January 29, 2015

Earnings: 5% of your course grade (plus 1% bonus)

Purpose: Programming and Using Dynamic Structures (buffers) with C
This is a review of and an exercise in C coding style, programming techniques, data types and
structures, memory management, and simple file input/output. It will give you a better
understanding of the type of internal data structures used by a simple compiler you will be building
this semester. This assignment will be also an exercise in “excessively defensive programming”.
You are to write functions that should be “overly” protected and should not abruptly terminate or
“crash” at run-time due to invalid function parameters, erroneous internal calculations, or memory
violations.
